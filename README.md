# -Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-ML
This project focuses on diagnosing brain tumors using various deep learning models, including Inception, VGG16, and a custom 6-layer convolutional neural network (CNN). The models are trained on a diverse dataset containing images of gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary tumors, and normal brain scans. The goal is to provide accurate and efficient tools for early detection and classification of brain tumors.
6 Layer CNN had 98% accuracy, Inception mdoel has 87 % accuracy, Vgg 16 had 97% accuracy
